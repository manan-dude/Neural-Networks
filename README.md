# Neural-Networks

Neural networks emerged from this drive for biologically inspired intelligent computing - and 
went on to become one of the most powerful and useful methods in the field of artificial intelligence.
Neural networks are already at the heart of everyday technology - like automatic car number plate recognition and 
decoding handwritten postcodes on your handwritten letters.
 
##  I have tried to a neural network that can be trained to recognise human handwritten characters.

###  PYTHON MODULES AND LIBRARIES THAT ARE USED HERE :


* NUMPY
* SCIPY
* IMAGEIO
* GLOB
 
 #### EXACTLY WHAT ?, THIS NEURAL NETWORKS WILL DO :

1. It will take our Handwritten Picture,
2. Do some processing and
3. Popped out an output.

#### SKELETON OF THE CODE
- initialisation - to set the number of input, hidden and output nodes 
- train - refine the weights after being given a training set example to learn from 
- query - give an answer from the output nodes after being given an input

##### If you have any queries about the source-code or anything regarding this project ask me , I will try to resolve your problem.
